## Abstract

As cyber threats grow in complexity and frequency, there is an urgent need for advanced cybersecurity solutions capable of adapting to evolving challenges. We introduce **TunSecure-AI**, an innovative framework that addresses emerging cybersecurity issues through a Zero-Touch Network (ZTN) architecture powered by Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Federated Learning (FL). TunSecure-AI creates a decentralized intrusion detection system that optimizes model selection and tuning while preserving data privacy across distributed networks. Our advanced monitoring dashboard enables real-time threat detection and automated response capabilities. Validation results demonstrate the systemâ€™s scalability and effectiveness, achieving an F1-score of 99.8% on the CICIDS2017 dataset and handling large network deployments efficiently. This positions Tunisia as a pioneer in next-generation cybersecurity solutions, contributing to a safer digital environment.

## Project Pipeline

Our project follows a structured pipeline to ensure efficient and effective intrusion detection. The pipeline consists of two main phases: **Data Analysis and Preprocessing** and **AutoML Pipeline and Procedures**.

### 1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing

Before diving into the AutoML processes, thorough data analysis and preprocessing are essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

#### Data Cleaning

- **Removing Duplicates**: Identified and removed duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
- **Handling Infinite Values**: Replaced infinite values in critical features with `NaN` to standardize the dataset.

#### Handling Missing Values

- **Identifying Missing Values**: Detected missing values in key features such as `Flow Bytes/s` and `Flow Packets/s`.
- **Imputing Missing Values**: Filled missing values using the median to preserve data distribution without introducing bias.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- **Visualization**: Utilized bar charts, boxplots, and histograms to understand feature distributions and identify outliers.
- **Insights**: Identified non-normal distributions and the presence of outliers in key features, guiding further preprocessing steps.

### 2. AutoML Pipeline and Procedures

The AutoML pipeline automates various stages of the machine learning workflow, enhancing efficiency and model performance.

#### Automated Data Pre-Processing

Ensures that the dataset is balanced to prevent bias in model training.

- **Data Balancing**: Employed Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) to generate synthetic samples for minority classes, mitigating class imbalance.

#### Automated Feature Engineering

Enhances feature quality by selecting and creating the most relevant features.

- **Feature Importance Averaging**: Aggregated feature importance scores from multiple tree-based models to select the most significant features, reducing dimensionality and improving model performance.

#### Automated Model Selection

Selects the best-performing machine learning model from a pool of candidates.

- **Model Pool**: Includes Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
- **Selection Criteria**: Evaluated models based on performance metrics to identify the optimal model for intrusion detection.

#### Hyper-Parameter Optimization

Optimizes model hyperparameters to enhance performance.

- **Bayesian Optimization with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (BO-TPE)**: Efficiently explored the hyperparameter space to identify optimal configurations, improving model accuracy and efficiency.

#### Automated Model Ensemble

Combines multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy and robustness.

- **Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE)**: Integrated predictions from selected models based on their confidence levels, enhancing final prediction accuracy and reliability.

## Implementation

### Machine Learning Algorithms

Our framework employs a diverse set of machine learning algorithms to ensure robust intrusion detection capabilities:

- **Decision Tree (DT)**
- **Random Forest (RF)**
- **Extra Trees (ET)**
- **XGBoost**
- **LightGBM**
- **CatBoost**

### Data Balancing Methods

- **Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE)**: Generates synthetic data to balance classes, improving model training on imbalanced datasets.

### Feature Selection Methods

- **Feature Importance Averaging**: Aggregates feature importance from multiple models to identify and select the most significant features.

### Optimization/AutoML Algorithms

- **Bayesian Optimization with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (BO-TPE)**: Optimizes hyperparameters by modeling the distribution of promising hyperparameters, enabling efficient search and selection.

### Ensemble Learning Algorithms

- **Stacking**: Combines multiple base models by training a meta-model to make final predictions.
- **Confidence-based Stacking**: Weighs base model predictions based on their confidence scores, enhancing ensemble performance.

### Cybersecurity Script

Included in the repository is a Python script named `cybersecurity.py`. This script is designed to block malicious destinations from receiving packets, enhancing network security by preventing unwanted or harmful traffic from reaching targeted sources.

- **Functionality**:
  - **Packet Blocking**: Identifies and blocks packets from specified malicious sources.
  - **Integration**: Can be integrated with existing security infrastructure to provide automated defense mechanisms.
  - **Customization**: Allows for specifying targets and conditions under which packets should be blocked.
