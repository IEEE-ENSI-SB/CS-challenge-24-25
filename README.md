Abstract
As cyber threats grow in complexity and frequency, there is an urgent need for advanced cybersecurity solutions capable of adapting to evolving challenges. We introduce TunSecure-AI, an innovative framework that addresses emerging cybersecurity issues through a Zero-Touch Network (ZTN) architecture powered by Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) and Federated Learning (FL). TunSecure-AI creates a decentralized intrusion detection system that optimizes model selection and tuning while preserving data privacy across distributed networks. Our advanced monitoring dashboard enables real-time threat detection and automated response capabilities. Validation results demonstrate the systemâ€™s scalability and effectiveness, achieving an F1-score of 99.8% on the CICIDS2017 dataset and handling large network deployments efficiently. This positions Tunisia as a pioneer in next-generation cybersecurity solutions, contributing to a safer digital environment.

Project Pipeline
Our project follows a structured pipeline to ensure efficient and effective intrusion detection. The pipeline consists of two main phases: Data Analysis and Preprocessing and AutoML Pipeline and Procedures.

1. Data Analysis and Preprocessing
Before diving into the AutoML processes, thorough data analysis and preprocessing are essential to ensure the quality and reliability of the dataset.

Data Cleaning
Removing Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate rows to maintain data integrity.
Handling Infinite Values: Replaced infinite values in critical features with NaN to standardize the dataset.
Handling Missing Values
Identifying Missing Values: Detected missing values in key features such as Flow Bytes/s and Flow Packets/s.
Imputing Missing Values: Filled missing values using the median to preserve data distribution without introducing bias.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualization: Utilized bar charts, boxplots, and histograms to understand feature distributions and identify outliers.
Insights: Identified non-normal distributions and the presence of outliers in key features, guiding further preprocessing steps.
2. AutoML Pipeline and Procedures
The AutoML pipeline automates various stages of the machine learning workflow, enhancing efficiency and model performance.

Automated Data Pre-Processing
Ensures that the dataset is balanced to prevent bias in model training.

Data Balancing: Employed Tabular Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) to generate synthetic samples for minority classes, mitigating class imbalance.
Automated Feature Engineering
Enhances feature quality by selecting and creating the most relevant features.

Feature Importance Averaging: Aggregated feature importance scores from multiple tree-based models to select the most significant features, reducing dimensionality and improving model performance.
Automated Model Selection
Selects the best-performing machine learning model from a pool of candidates.

Model Pool: Includes Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost.
Selection Criteria: Evaluated models based on performance metrics to identify the optimal model for intrusion detection.
Hyper-Parameter Optimization
Optimizes model hyperparameters to enhance performance.

Bayesian Optimization with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (BO-TPE): Efficiently explored the hyperparameter space to identify optimal configurations, improving model accuracy and efficiency.
Automated Model Ensemble
Combines multiple models to improve overall prediction accuracy and robustness.

Optimized Confidence-based Stacking Ensemble (OCSE): Integrated predictions from selected models based on their confidence levels, enhancing final prediction accuracy and reliability.
